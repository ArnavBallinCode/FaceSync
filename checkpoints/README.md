# Checkpoints

This folder contains checkpoint files created during database building. Each checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoint_1000.json`) allows you to resume or test the database at various stages of processing.

- Use with the lightning API for partial database testing.
- Useful for debugging, incremental builds, and recovery.
